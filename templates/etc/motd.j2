Hey! Welcome to {{ ansible_hostname }}. Before you go further, there is
probably a better way to do what you're trying to do. Check out the
following:

{% for item in motd_urls %}
  → {{ item.message }}
      {{ item.url }}
{% endfor %}

If you are unable to fix what you need with the above, rather than
read or modify the server now, please lodge a ticket with sysadmin.

[0;31mYou should not need to SSH into a server![0m
